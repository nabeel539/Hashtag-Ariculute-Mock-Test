          Agriculture believes in helping its customers as much as possible and
          has a liberal cancellation policy. However, cancellations are not
          entertained for products that are offered as part of special
          promotions or limited-time offers (e.g., Holi, Diwali,
          Valentine&apos;s Day, specific examinations). These limited-occasion
          offers are non-cancellable.
